Incremental updating is a strategy used to create a summary of a text that has been split into smaller chunks.

To create the summary, we iterate through each chunk of text in order, and update a global summary with new and important information that is learned in each new chunk.

Three prompts are required for incremental updating:

Prompt 1: Summarising a single chunk.

Prompt 2: Updating the global summary.

Prompt 3: Compressing the global summary when it becomes longer than the target maximum summary length.
