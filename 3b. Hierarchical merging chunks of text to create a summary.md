Hierarchical merging is a strategy used to create a summary of a text that has been split into smaller chunks.

To create the summary, each chunk of text is summarised individually. Then each summary is recursively merged until one summary is left of the entire input document.

Three prompts are required for hierarchical merging:

Prompt 1: Summarise a single chunk of text.

Prompt 2: Merge two chunk-level summaries.

Prompt 3: Merge two summaries with added context from previously-generated merged summaries.
