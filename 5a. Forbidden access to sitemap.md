When I tried to get the sitemap for this url "https://www.prpimaging.com.au/wpsl_stores-sitemap.xml", using the code in [[5. Get urls from sitemap]], I got the following error:

```bash
xml.etree.ElementTree.ParseError: mismatched tag: line 6, column 2
```

This didn't make sense, so I printed out the result of the sitemap content that was returned:

```python
import requests  
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET  
  
  
def extract_urls_from_sitemap(sitemap_url):  
  # Fetch the sitemap content  
  response = requests.get(sitemap_url)  
  sitemap_content = response.content 

print(sitemap_content)
```

Which returned:

```bash
b'<html>\r\n<head><title>403 Forbidden</title></head>\r\n<body>\r\n<center><h1>403 Forbidden</h1></center>\r\n<hr><center>nginx</center>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n'
```
This means that for whatever reason, access to the sitemap is being denied.
